# Assignment 6 — Build an AI-Assisted Linux Health Check (AI-Assisted Linux Incident Triage)

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build a read-only Bash triage script that checks the health of your Ubuntu server and Nginx application, connect it to Claude Code as a reusable `/linux-triage` skill, simulate a controlled Nginx incident, use the skill to gather and analyze evidence, recover the service manually, and verify recovery. The workflow follows the Agentic Loop: Gather → Analyze → Human Act → Verify.

---

# Task 1 — Confirm the Healthy Baseline and Create the Workspace

## Goal

Confirm that Nginx and the React application are healthy before building the automation.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Output of `systemctl is-active nginx`, `ss -ltn | grep ':80'`, and `curl -I http://localhost`

### Notes

Answer the following in your own words:

**1. What proves that Nginx is running?**

When I run systemctl is-active nginx, it returns active. This confirms that Nginx is running.


---

**2. What proves that the server is listening for HTTP traffic?**

The output of ss -ltn | grep ':80' shows that port 80 is listening. This means the server is ready to receive HTTP requests.


---

**3. Why must you capture a healthy baseline before simulating an incident?**

First, I need to make sure everything is working correctly. After simulating the incident, I can compare the failed state with the healthy state to understand what changed. Once I fix the issue, I can check again to confirm that everything is back to normal.


---

# Task 2 — Create Project Context and Safety Rules in CLAUDE.md

## Goal

Tell Claude exactly what this project does and what it is not allowed to do.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — CLAUDE.md open in VS Code showing all four sections (Project Overview, Incident Workflow, Safety Rules, Output Rules)

![alt text](screenshots\sc3-T2-ass6-week3.png)

---

### Notes

Answer the following in your own words:

**1. Why should Claude receive project-specific operational rules?**

Claude needs project-specific rules so it understands what the project is for, which steps to follow, and which actions it must avoid. This helps Claude give answers that match the incident workflow instead of making unnecessary changes.


---

**2. Why is the human required to execute the recovery command?**

The human must review the evidence and decide whether the recovery command is safe before running it. Claude can recommend a command, but it should not make changes to the server by itself.

---

**3. Which rule prevents Claude from making an unsupported diagnosis?**

The rule “Do not claim a root cause unless the report contains supporting evidence” prevents Claude from giving a diagnosis that is not supported by the report.



---

# Task 3 — Use Agentic AI to Plan Before Writing the Script

## Goal

Use Claude Code to inspect the environment and produce a read-only plan before creating any Bash code.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Claude Code showing the five-check plan and read-only inspection results

![alt text](screenshots\sc4.4-T3-ass6-week3.png)


### Notes

Answer the following in your own words:

**1. Which part of this task represents the Gather phase?**

The read-only inspection of the Ubuntu server represents the Gather phase. Claude uses commands to collect information about Nginx, port 80, the HTTP response, disk usage, and available memory.

---

**2. Did Claude follow the instruction not to create files? How did you verify this?**

Yes, Claude followed the instruction and only performed read-only checks. I verified this by listing the files in the workspace and confirming that no Bash script or other new file was created.


---

**3. Why is planning before coding useful in DevOps automation?**

Planning helps me decide what the script should check and what each result means before writing the code. It also helps me identify missing or unsafe steps early, instead of finding them after the script has already been created.


---

# Task 4 — Build the Linux Triage Bash Script

## Goal

Create one Bash script that gathers consistent Linux and Nginx health evidence.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — Top section of `linux-triage.sh` showing variables, thresholds, and the checks array

![alt text](screenshots\sc5-T4-ass6-week3.png)

---

#### Screenshot 6 — Middle section showing check functions and conditionals

---

#### Screenshot 7 — Bottom section showing the loop, summary function, and exit behavior

![alt text](screenshots\sc7-T4-ass6-week3.png)

---

#### Screenshot 8 — Output of `bash -n scripts/linux-triage.sh` (no syntax errors) and `ls -l scripts/linux-triage.sh` showing executable permission

![alt text](screenshots\sc5-T4-ass6-week3.png)

![alt text](screenshots\sc5-T4-ass6-week3.png)

### Notes

Answer the following in your own words:

**1. What is stored in the checks array?**

The checks array stores the names of the five functions that check the Nginx service, port 80, HTTP response, disk usage, and available memory.


---

**2. How does the `for` loop use that array?**

The for loop reads each function name from the array and runs the functions one at a time. This allows the script to complete all five health checks in the given order.


---

**3. Why are the health checks separated into functions?**

Each function handles one specific check. This makes the script easier to read, test, update, and troubleshoot without affecting the other checks.


---

**4. What is the purpose of `$(...)` in this script?**

$(...) runs a command and stores its output. For example, the script uses it to collect the timestamp, hostname, HTTP status code, disk usage, available memory, and recent Nginx logs.


---

**5. Why does the script use different exit codes for HEALTHY, WARN, and FAIL?**

The exit code shows the final condition of the Ubuntu server after completing the five health checks.
The exit codes allow a user or another automation tool to understand the final result without reading the complete report:
0 means all checks passed.
1 means the script found a warning.
2 means at least one check failed.
This helps us quickly understand how serious the issue is after running the triage script. 




---

# Task 5 — Run and Understand the Healthy-State Report

## Goal

Run the Bash script against the healthy server and verify that it creates a report.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 9 — Output of `./scripts/linux-triage.sh` showing your Full Name and all five check results

![alt text](screenshots\sc9-T5-ass6-week3.png)

---

#### Screenshot 10 — Output showing the captured exit code and final summary

![alt text](screenshots\sc10-T5-ass6-week3.png)

---

### Notes

Answer the following in your own words:

**1. What is the overall status of your healthy baseline?**

The overall status of my baseline is HEALTHY. The report does not contain any failed checks, so I can continue to the incident simulation.


---

**2. Which exact Linux evidence proves the application is serving traffic?**

The report shows:
[PASS] Port 80 is listening
[PASS] Local HTTP check returned status 200

Port 80 listening confirms that the server is ready to receive HTTP traffic. The HTTP status 200 confirms that the application responded successfully through Nginx.


---

**3. Did your script return exit code 0 or 1? Explain why.**

My script returned exit code 0 because all five health checks passed. Nginx was active, port 80 was listening, the application returned HTTP 200, and the disk and memory values were within the healthy limits.


---

**4. What is the difference between a warning and a failure in this script?**

A warning means the server and application are still working, but the script found a resource condition that needs attention. This happens when root disk usage is between 80% and 89%, or available memory is below 100 MB.
A failure means a serious health check did not pass. This happens when Nginx is inactive, port 80 is not listening, the application does not return HTTP 200, or root disk usage reaches 90% or higher.



---

# Task 6 — Create and Run the /linux-triage Skill

## Goal

Turn the Bash script into a reusable, manually invoked Agentic AI workflow.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 11 — `SKILL.md` showing the frontmatter, allowed tool restrictions, and safety rules


![alt text](screenshots\sc11-T6-ass6-week3.png)

---

#### Screenshot 12 — `/linux-triage` output for the healthy server


![alt text](screenshots\sc12-T6-ass6-week3.png)

---

### Notes

Answer the following in your own words:

**1. Why does this skill have Bash, Read, and Grep, but not Write?**

The skill needs Bash to run the Linux triage script, Read to open the generated report, and Grep to locate specific PASS, WARN, or FAIL results. It does not need the Write tool because Claude should not create or edit project files during the triage process.



---

**2. Why is `disable-model-invocation: true` useful for this skill?**

This setting prevents Claude from choosing and running the skill automatically. I must manually invoke /linux-triage, which keeps the server inspection under my control.



---

**3. What part is performed by Bash, and what part is performed by Claude?**

The Bash script checks Nginx, port 80, the HTTP response, disk usage, available memory, and recent logs. It records the results in linux-health-report.txt.
Claude reads that report, explains the results, identifies warnings or failures, and recommends a safe next step. Claude does not perform the recovery action.



---

**4. Why is this better than asking Claude "Is my server healthy?" without giving it evidence?**
A general question does not give Claude enough information about the actual server. The /linux-triage skill first collects current evidence using the Bash script. Claude then bases its answer on the Nginx status, listening port, HTTP response, disk usage, memory, and logs instead of guessing.


---

# Task 7 — Simulate an Nginx Incident and Let the Skill Diagnose It

## Goal

Create a controlled service failure, gather evidence through Bash, and let Claude analyze the evidence without taking recovery action.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 13 — Output showing Nginx is inactive and the HTTP request fails

![alt text](screenshots\sc13-T7-ass6-week3.png)

---

#### Screenshot 14 — `/linux-triage` output showing failed evidence, most likely cause, and a suggested recovery command

![alt text](screenshots\sc14-T7-ass6-week3.png)

---

#### Screenshot 15 — `incident-failure-report.txt` showing the failed checks and your Full Name

![alt text](screenshots\sc15-T7-ass6-week3.png)

---

### Notes

Answer the following in your own words:

**1. Which three checks failed?**

The Nginx service check, port 80 check, and local HTTP check failed. The disk and memory checks were not affected by stopping Nginx.

---

**2. What evidence supports the conclusion that Nginx is unavailable?**

The report shows that Nginx is not active, port 80 is not listening, and the local HTTP request returned status 000. Together, these results show that Nginx is unavailable and the application cannot receive HTTP traffic.


---

**3. Did Claude execute the recovery command? Why is that important?**

No, Claude only recommended the recovery command. This is important because I must review the evidence and approve the action before making a change to the server. It prevents an AI tool from changing the service automatically during an incident.


---

**4. Which phase of the Agentic Loop is represented by the Bash report?**

The Bash report represents the Gather phase. The script collects current evidence about Nginx, port 80, the HTTP response, disk usage, memory, and recent logs.


---

**5. Which phase is represented by Claude's explanation?**

The Bash report represents the Gather phase. The script collects current evidence about Nginx, port 80, the HTTP response, disk usage, memory, and recent logs.


---

# Task 8 — Recover Manually, Verify Again, and Write the Incident Summary

## Goal

Recover the service as the human operator and prove that the system is healthy again.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 16 — Output showing Nginx is active and `curl -I http://localhost` returns 200 OK


![alt text](screenshots\sc16-T8-ass6-week3.png)
---

#### Screenshot 17 — Second `/linux-triage` output showing successful recovery with no FAIL results

![alt text](screenshots\sc17-T8-ass6-week3.png)

---

#### Screenshot 18 — Output of `ls -lah reports` showing both `incident-failure-report.txt` and `recovery-report.txt`

![alt text](screenshots\sc18-T8-ass6-week3.png)

---

#### Screenshot 19 — `incident-summary.md` showing all required sections and your Full Name

![alt text](screenshots\sc19-T8-ass6-week3.png)

---

### Notes

Answer the following in your own words:

**1. What action did you execute manually?**

After reviewing the evidence and Claude’s recommendation, I manually ran:
sudo systemctl start nginx

This started the Nginx service again.


---

**2. What evidence proves that the service recovered?**

The systemctl is-active nginx command returned active, and the local HTTP request returned HTTP/1.1 200 OK. The second /linux-triage run also showed that the service, port, and HTTP checks passed.


---

**3. Why is the second triage run necessary?**

Starting Nginx does not automatically prove that the complete application is healthy. The second triage run checks the service, port, HTTP response, disk, and memory again to confirm that the server returned to a healthy state.


---

**4. What could go wrong if an AI agent automatically restarted every failed service?**

A failed service may have a configuration problem, resource issue, dependency failure, or another serious cause. Automatically restarting every service could hide the real problem, create a restart loop, or make the incident worse. The evidence should be reviewed before taking action.


---

**5. In one sentence, explain the difference between using AI as a chatbot and using AI in this agentic workflow.**

A chatbot only answers my question, but in this agentic workflow, Claude uses tools to gather and analyze real server evidence while I remain responsible for approving and performing the recovery action.
